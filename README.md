### Planning
In the design phase I have already designed 4 iterations of one design and one iteration of another. I am done designing but think there was a better way to streamline the User Flow so that I could use less screens. However I do think because so much of my designs I designed to be re-used as either components, or have the same style that will allow me to cut down on time when it comes to design and styling.
Here is my current design flow: ![Hifi Design Screens](HIfi.png)

#### Frontend
1. Features:
    - Task management by Projects
    - Delete Tasks
    - Create Tasks
    - Project toggle
    - Music toggle
    - Task status management
    - Updates (need to think more about what updates, like edit the task, edit the due date?)
2. Screens:
    - Register
    - Login
    - Projects
    - Add Projects
    - Transition Screen
    - Add task details
    - Populated Tasks
3. Reusable components
    - Form textboxes
    - Buttons
    - Header/Navbar
    - Project modal
    - Task modal
    - Task cards
4. CRUD On:
   - User

5. Design:
  - Title: She Sync
  - Logo: ![Logo](2.png)
  - Colors : E9FF86, FFB2E8, F6F5AE , FC6431
  - Font: Instrument Serif
6. State Logic:
 So projects will have to be tracked I plan on using a drop down as I think that will make it much easier, and then the project selected will have to be loaded, because tasks are nested in projects that should be easier to handle than by user. A user will also have to update task status, add tasks, and delete tasks.
